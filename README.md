# Adventure Nest

## üìù About
AdventureNest is a web-based application designed to simplify the process of renting properties. It offers an intuitive platform for property owners to list their homes, upload photographs, and automate the object detection process for efficient property management. 

Additionally, when renting out their homes once a home owner uploads a photograph of their property, the application utilizes a deep learning module which automatically detects objects within the photograph and provides a list of items that the home owner contains within their home.
